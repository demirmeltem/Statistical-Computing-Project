# Airplane Crash Analysis
Aircraft Crash Data Analysis is for over 100 years beginning from the year 1908 to 2008. Air travel is the one of
the most common transport in these days. The main purpose is to find which factor is more effecting on air crash.
There is always reason to happen these air crashes. In this data frame, I believe that I can find a factor to cause these
situations. It is important to examine our progress in overcoming the crashes.

The data used for this analysis is a public dataset hosted by open Data by Vincen Tarel Bundock. Various data
cleaning steps were performed to work on a tidy dataset. After calculations, graphs were plotted to visualize the
results and come to a conclusion.
